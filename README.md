# Resume Parser AI Project

* Recruiters spend a lot of time skimming through resumes to find the best candidate for a job position. Since there can be hundreds of applications for a single position, this process has been automated in several ways as the most common is keyword matching. You can build a resume parser with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques that can skim through a candidate’s application and identify skilled candidates, filtering out people who fill their resume with unnecessary keywords.

* **Project Idea**: You can use the Resume Dataset available on Kaggle to build this model. This dataset contains only two columns - job title and the candidate’s resume information. The data is present in the form of text and needs to be pre-processed and you can use the NLTK Python library for this data preparation process. Then, you can build a clustering algorithm that groups closely related words and skills that a candidate should possess in each domain. Words that are similar in context (and not just keywords) should be considered. You can assign a final weightage score to each resume from 0 (least favourable) to 10 (most favourable). This is the most beginner-friendly project if you want to learn AI.

* **Tools and Libraries**: Python, NLTK

* **Dataset**: Kaggle Resume Dataset

## Lets breakdown this project step by step:

### Data Processing

* First, convert all text to lowercase for consistency
* Remove special characters, numbers, and punctuation
* Remove common stop words using NTLK's (Natural Language Toolkit) stop words list
* Perform lemmatization to convert words to their base form (e.g., "programming" --> "program")
* Create custom stop words specific to resumes (like "name", "address", "phone")

### Feature Extraction

* Use NLTK to identify parts of speech (POS tagging)
* Extract Key entities like:
    * Skills (technical, soft skill)
    * Education qualifications
    * Work experience duration
    * Job titles
* Create a custom skills dictionary for different domains
* use word tokenization to break down text into individual words
* Implement N-gram to capture phrases (e.g., "machine learning", "data science")

### Text Vectorization

* Apply TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization
* This converts text data into numerical features
* Helps identify important words while reducing the impact of common words
* Creates a document-term matrix

### Clustering Algorithm

* use K-means clustering to group similar resumes
* Alternative: use hierarchical clustering if you want to see relationships between clusters
* Determine optimal number of clusters using elbow method
* Each cluster would represent a job dommain skill set

### Semantic Similarity

* Use Word2vec or similar word embedding to capture context
* This helps identify similar words (e.g., "Python" being related to "programming")
* Calculate similarity scores between resume content and job requirements
* Calculate similarity scores between resume content and job requirements
* Consider using cosine similarity for comparing vectors

### Scoring System (0-10)

* Create a weighted scoring formula considering:
    * Skill match (40% weight)
    * Experience relevance (30% weight)
    * Education relevance (20% weight)
    * Additional relevant keywords (10% weight)
* Normalize scores to 0-10 range
* Add bonus points for exact matches with critical skills
* Penalize for missing mandatory skills

### validation

* Cross-validate results woth a subset of manually scored resumes
* Adjust weights and parameters based on validation results
* Calculate accurancy metrics
* Fine-time the model based on feedback

### Optimization

* Handle edge cases (very short or very long resumes)
* Deal woth spelling mistakes using fuzzy matching
* Consider industry-specific terminology
* Regulae updates to skills dictionary as new technologies emerge

This approach combines both rule-based and machine learning methods to create a robust resume parsing system. The NLTK library provides most of the necessary tools for text processing, while clustering helps in understanding patterns and similarities in the data.
