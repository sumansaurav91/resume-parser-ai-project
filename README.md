# Resume Parser AI Project

* Recruiters spend a lot of time skimming through resumes to find the best candidate for a job position. Since there can be hundreds of applications for a single position, this process has been automated in several ways as the most common is keyword matching. You can build a resume parser with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques that can skim through a candidate’s application and identify skilled candidates, filtering out people who fill their resume with unnecessary keywords.

* **Project Idea**: You can use the Resume Dataset available on Kaggle to build this model. This dataset contains only two columns - job title and the candidate’s resume information. The data is present in the form of text and needs to be pre-processed and you can use the NLTK Python library for this data preparation process. Then, you can build a clustering algorithm that groups closely related words and skills that a candidate should possess in each domain. Words that are similar in context (and not just keywords) should be considered. You can assign a final weightage score to each resume from 0 (least favourable) to 10 (most favourable). This is the most beginner-friendly project if you want to learn AI.

* **Tools and Libraries**: Python, NLTK

* **Dataset**: Kaggle Resume Dataset
